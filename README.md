# cpt-AR (Change-point analysis with single influx records)

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Determines zone boundaries for single influx records using the change-point analysis
as described in Finsinger et al. (2016).

--
The function requires one input file with five columns:

Column 1: CmI          =   top sample depth, interpolated

Column 2: AgeI            =   top sample age (as cal yrs BP), interpolated

Column 3: sedArI    =   sediment accumulation rate as from age-depth model (as cm year-1), interpolated

Column 4: countI           =   raw data (counts, areas, other)

Column 5: volI             =   sample volume, interpolated

Column 6: ConcI          =   concentration (as pieces cm-3), interpolated

Column 7: ArI            =   influx (or accumulation rate) value (as pieces cm-2 yr-1), interpolated


--
The function requires following parameters (which can be left at default values)

 Name      =   Site name
 
 bootstrap =   if TRUE, the random concentration record is generated by random sampling with replacement from ConcI; if FALSE
               the random numbers (rand.i) are generated with the following constrain: min(ConcI) < rand.i < max(ConcI) 
 
 q         =   number of random datasets generated 
 
 n.Q       =   the maximum number of change points
 
 n.screen  =   a change point in the random datasets is validated if it occurs in more than n.screen datasets.

By default n.screen = q * 0.025 (thus with q=1000 this equals 2.5% chance of occurrence)
